NOTE:
This is still a work in progress (or maybe not lol). However, it is uncertain whether this game will ever get another update (other than small changes) after 2022 Jul 4 or not.

How to Play & Information:
A bunch of enemies are approaching and attacking you! Use the 8 spells that you have to defend yourself!
Drag a spell to where you want to use it and then release, boom! You just cast a spell!

Spell information:

**gèn** (Gen): 1. Deals massive damage to every enemy on the screen. 2. Gives the player 3 seconds of gen gen state, during which the player is immune to all damage and shoots gen bullets rapidly. 3. The player gains HP slightly.

**buěn tyĕ** (Ice Attack): Freezes and deals slight damage to every enemy in a triangular area. When the player's HP is lower than a specific number, the freeze time becomes longer as the Player's HP lowers.

**ò˞ fyuù** (Typhoon): Deals damage to and drags every enemy in a circular area towards the area's center. However, enemies inside the eye of the typhoon are not affected.

**pià** (Slap): Creates a small explosion that damages any ememy touching it. This spell has a meter, which slightly increases every time the player uses this spell; additionally, it significantly increases when the player successfully eliminates an enemy with this spell. When the meter reaches 6 or higher, the next time the player uses this spell, it will subtract 6 from the meter and create huge explosions and deal more damage.

**dòng ngōng** (Shock Wave): Shoots shock waves from the player that deal significant damage to enemies and knock them back. This spell shoots more shock waves as the player's HP lowers.

**hòng giú** (Fire Ball): Deals a lot of damage to every enemy in a circular area. When the player's HP is lower than a specific number, the damage gets higher as the Player's HP lowers.

**shyū tuá** (Absorption): Deals slight damage to every enemy in a square area, and the player will gain the same amount of HP as a percentage of the damage dealt, that is, the more enemies are hit by this spell, the more HP the player will gain. When the player's HP is lower than a specific number, the damage gets higher and more percentage is absorbed as the Player's HP lowers.

**jìn tsuyù** (Poison Field): Creates a pentagonal poison field, any enemy that touches it will be damaged slowly over time. When the player's HP is lower than a specific number, the poison field lasts longer as the Player's HP lowers.
